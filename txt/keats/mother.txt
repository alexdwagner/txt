have smothered me in
the old grandmother of
with clouds
 and thy mother
hear exactly how you
natural pride i am
smothered in absurdities--a poor
of insensibility; his mother
for the violence of
mother was well by
round into shreds like
we shall return to
admire the exact admeasurement
whereat i scrutinised and
in her teeth but
about her and her
must not forget to
a child in arms
as i dare say
your mother and charles
repeated at supper time
he will undoubtedly die
something about your mother
not what to say
have in seeing your
not his mothers true
thinking you might want
a letter from george
father and mother
end? god bless her
